# About development

This webapp was developed using React to ensure wide compatibility across a wide range of devices. Testing occurring simultaneously on both traditional and touch devices, to ensure feature parity and a unified user-experience. Additionally, because React comes with PWA support by default (as well as 'Add to Home Screen' support on Apple devices), a nearly-native feel is just a click away for users who'd prefer a more packaged experience.
